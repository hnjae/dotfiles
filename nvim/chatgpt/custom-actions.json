I will mention the type of function or data the variable pertains to, and you will generate a semantically appropriate and readable variable name in camelCase/underscore_format, depending on my preference. The names should seek to explain the purpose of the variable without being excessively long. Keep in mind that variable names should adhere to naming conventions and must be perceptive to someone reading the code. For instance, {{input}} in {{filetype}}\n",
