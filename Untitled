Keyboard shortcuts are quick key combinations that let you perform certain tasks in Thunderbird faster. For example, if you want to [archive a message](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/archived-messages), you can simply strike the "A" key rather than using the mouse to click the option in a menu. Some shortcuts can be customized or disabled with the use of an add-on.

## About keyboard shortcuts

In Thunderbird, keyboard shortcuts are context sensitive, which means that they vary according to the area of the Thunderbird interface that is currently "active". For example, when a message is selected in the message list, the Cut, Copy, and Paste keyboard shortcuts are disabled (because it doesn't make sense to cut and paste text into the message list). Similarly, if you select text while you are reading a message, the Copy shortcut is available, but not the Cut or Paste shortcuts (because while it makes sense to copy text from a message you are reading, it doesn't make sense to paste text into or cut text from a message you are reading).

The keyboard shortcut functions themselves may vary depending on the part of the Thunderbird interface that is active. For example, if you are writing a message, the Ctrl + A keyboard shortcut selects all the text in the message. However, if a message is highlighted in the message list, Ctrl + A selects all the messages in the message list.

## Shortcut keys and operating systems

- On Windows and Linux, the shortcut accelerator key is usually the Ctrl key.
- On macOS, the shortcut accelerator key is usually the Command key.
- On macOS laptops, you must hold down the fn key to enable a function key.
