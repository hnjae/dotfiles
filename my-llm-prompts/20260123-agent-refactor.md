# Refactor for Idiomatic Excellence

Refactor the code following the target language's conventions, best practices, and paradigm-appropriate patterns (OOP, functional, etc.). Achieve clean, idiomatic code that exemplifies the language's philosophy.

## Decision Authority

- You have full authority to make breaking changes (internal or user-facing)
- Prefer established libraries over custom code when they improve quality
- Verify behavior through code inspection; don't assume documentation is accurate
- Ensure consistency across all artifacts

## Workflow

1. Create a plan with specific todos
2. Commit after completing each todo (not just at the end)
3. Use conventional commit format, noting any breaking changes
4. Add this footer to all commit messages:
